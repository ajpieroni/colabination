# Colabination

## What is this project about?
Colabination is a game developed that allows students who want to learn more about the Co-Lab space, specifically the Studio. We used games like [Little Alchemy 2](https://littlealchemy2.com) and [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) as inspiration for Colabination. Although the game can get creative at times, for example, a combination of a doll and a dining table makes a family, we give a general idea of what tools the Studio offers students, such as scissors, hammers, sewing machine, Cricut, soldering station, etc. Overall, we want every student, graduate or undergraduate, Trinity or Pratt, to feel comfortable coming into the space and being able to express their creativity!
