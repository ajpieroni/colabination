# Colabination

## What is this project about?
Colabination is a game developed that allows students who want to learn more about the Co-Lab space, specifically the Studio. We used games like [Little Alchemy 2](https://littlealchemy2.com) and [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) as inspiration for Colabination. Although the game can get creative at times, for example, a combination of a doll and a dining table makes a family, we give a general idea of what tools the Studio offers students, such as scissors, hammers, sewing machine, Cricut, soldering station, etc. Overall, we want every student, graduate or undergraduate, Trinity or Pratt, to feel comfortable coming into the space and being able to express their creativity!


## Dev Stack

Colabination is developed using Kaboom.js and Ruby on Rails, with Docker. MySQL is used as the database, storing the users, combinations, tools, and items. 

### Frontend

### Backend
**Framework**: [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)\
**Database**: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)

### Source Control

## How to run the project
### 1. Installation
  * Clone project from Gitlab: https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/colab-insomnia-dev/colab-games
  * Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### 2. Set up Enviornment
  * Build docker image and start application
    * `cd path/to/colab-games`
    * `docker-compose build` - builds the images
    * `docker-compose up` - command to start the application
  * Go to localhost:3000 in your browser

### 3. docker-compose commands
  * `docker-compose build` - builds the images. This must be run if we install more npm packages
  * `docker-compose up` - starts the containers (react, express, mongo)
  * `docker-compose down` - tears down  the containers, run this when done
  * `docker-compose exec <servicename> bash` - give you a bash shell in your selected container replace *servicename* with service, e.g. backend, frontend, db. 
  * `docker-compose logs -f servicename` - attach terimal to log output of a service
  * `docker container ls` â€” views all the running containers
  * `docker system prune` -- delete all images and volumes to free up space
