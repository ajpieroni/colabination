# Discovery
## Alex: Notes on Little Alchemy
### Gaming Mechanics
- Mixing elements: The game revolves around mixing different elements to discover new ones. This includes combining like elements (x on x) as well as different elements (x on y).
- Combination results: There is either a new element created, or an element that has already been made.
  - On a new element, it will highlight on the screen.
  - On an old element, if made with an already discovered combintation, the result will flash up, but not combine. If it's a new combination, the element is made.
- Basic items: unlocked by statisfying certain conditions, not a combination
- Unlockable items: available when you accomplish certain goals
- Depleted items: once the item has gone through all possible combinations, no longer visible in sidebar
- Final items: can't be combined with anything, can remove by clicking on them in the canvas.
- Encyclopedia: holds records of combinations and resulting elements the user has created
### User Experience
- Music: 
  - There is a sound effect for a user combining items, along with retro music in the background which adds to the vibe.
- Animation/effects:
  - Item grows larger when user grabs it
  - Circle around item attempted to combine with
  - Shaking effect on failed combination
  - Double clicking on item duplicates it
  - If you click on a element below another, it's brought to the front
- Visuals: 
  - New element is focused on screen
  - Some elements have boxes around them indicating... they're depleted?
  - Depleted items have circles around them on the canvas
  - Clean up button to clear canvas

### Other things to note:
- I think there could be a timer going on in the background that would auto provide possible combinations when the user gets stuck.


## Sophia Bae:

### What are the gaming mechanics? 
- Rules
You combine elements together, two at a time. The game starts with the elements, “air,” “earth,” “fire,” and “water.” You cannot recreate an existing element.
- Number of players
There is one player for Alchemy who controls which elements are combined.
- Steps
You start out with two elements of your choice. Then, you drag one onto another to create a new element. Some elements do not combine well with each other and do not allow players to create new elements. 
- Goal
The goal of alchemy is to unlock and create all elements that exist within the game through experimentation.
	 
### What is the user-experience? 
- Art style
The art style is characterized by cartoon icons. The color scheme revolves around the colors, brown and yellow, with exceptions to the actual element icons. For example, the general icons and font colors are yellow against a brown background.
- Music
The music is characterized by retro-style. There are sound effects when elements are selected and combined.
- Animation
There is a shaking animation when two elements cannot combine. When two elements can combine, there is a circling/scaling animation. Then, the game displays a full page of the new element, with slight scaling movement. There are also rays that revolve around the new element. To resume back to the game, the new element zooms out and its opacity reduces. There is also a clean-up animation that swipes the entire screen and rids the existing elements that were dragged out onto the “play area.”
- Interactions
The player drags elements on top of each other. There are clicks to exit out of a new element and to access general icons, like “settings” and hints.

### Any other things you notice that are super interesting.
- It’s interesting to see how players cannot create an existing element twice or more. It seems a little restrictive in that sense, but it seems to help with experimentation purposes.


## Dasol's Notes on Little Alchemy
### Gaming Mechanics
- Rule 
  - combine stuff together and create new things from basic elements (can combine with itself or new elements)
- Players
  - 1 necessary, but more is fun since more ideas
- Steps 
  - combine things together! Doesn't let you make same element unless its through a different method tho
- Goals 
  - make cool stuff like life and penguins :D (end goal is to make everything that exists)


### User Experience
- Art Style
  - very cute drawings, cozy vibes with music
- Music 
  - has chill background music from a playlist
  - has other sound effects for combining elements
- Animation
  - jiggle effect (and sounds) when you can't combine elements
  - circle and ta da animations for when you combine and create new element
- Interactions
  - user can drag elements onto eachother to combine
  - other general settings buttons to toggle music/sound
  - can click for a hint/encyclopedia to see past work
  - also clean up clears the board, very useful!

### Other things to note:
- hint system could be improved, currently not dependent on where you're stuck so it just suggests random stuff and it opens to a new tab - would be better if it's dependent on what elements you have
- maybe like a line up feature could be nice to clean up the board without having to clear it?


## Olivia Chen:

### Gaming Mechanics:
- Rules: Combine objects to make new objects! Very little instruction. Find out what works and what doesnt
- Number of players: One. Yourself.
- Steps: Combine items. Make new ones. Test new combinations.
  - Can't create same object unless through new methods
- Goal: Unlock all elements

### User Experience:
- User config settings: can clean up, login, reset progress, contact them, turn on/off music + sounds
- Encyclopedia:
  - Home: short news headline, basic stats of discovered items, tips/did you know, recently discoverd
  - Items: search bar, sort by categories, add to board button, info page for specific things:
    - includes short desc, which categories item belongs in, combos made/undiscovered combos
  - Stats: x/720 discovered items 4 basic items
  - News: announcement board
  - notification badges appear when new items are made
- Hints: 
  - brings u to new page tells u about some tips and tricks to get new items
  - click button to get a random hint or watch an ad to get a personalized hint
  - can click items within items within items when in hints to get what creates an item if you don't know yet 
- Art Style: Cute, simple, clean
- Music/Sound: 
  - music is calming and simple. can sometimes be silent for long times between songs. would rather have a fade in/fade out (my earbuds are messed up so it might just be a me thing)
  - sound: little drop noise when picking and putting down item. shake effect when failed combo. zip noise when creating something. pop noise when new combo appears short high pitched zip noise when dragging item off board to delete. high pitched drop noise when attempting to recreate using same method. drop noise when press clean up
- Animation: 
  - New Creation: centers items and name (slight expand/depress) gives small description. spinning rays
  - Final item: lighter circle background that pulses. then closes and becomes foreground when pressed on.
  - Failed combo: small shake
  - Hover over item small background circle same with drag item over other item
  - Failed recreation: shake and the already created item appears as a smaller icon fading in from the top
  - Clean up: black box overtakes whole board from right and fades into normal background
  - Double clean up: black box reappears and disappears to the right and gives u back board u just cleaned up
- Interaction:
  - double click item to create copy on board.
  - drag item off board to remove.
  - clean up: removes whole board
  - clean up x2: returns whole board
  - user drags items together to attempt combos
  - search bar: search for item by name
  

### Other things of note:
- Kind've want a back button for when I create smth I already created in a new method. 
- no noise when pressing a final item. kinda want one.
- most user mechanics found by playing around myself. not super self explanatory but many will find these mechanics eventually
- board can get messy fast. idk if there's much of a fix.
- perhaps during failed creation, item held can slowly float to where grabbed from.
- maybe a bit boring? perhaps more mini goals + rewards along the way? missions maybe?

##Kelvin's Notes on Alchemy
###Gaming Mechanics
  
Rules: 
- Create everything possible in the game 
- Only allowed to combine two things at once
- If a combination is not allowed or element is already created, it will make a sound that doesn’t allow for the combination to be made

Number of Players: 
- 1 player needed although adding a multiplayer option would make the time to create items faster
Steps:
- No true step to reach the end goal. Multiple ways to reach all item created
Goals:
- Create all the items 
- Explore your imagination

###User Experience:
Art style:
- Very nice cartoon drawings of elements 
Music:
- Some music to go along the creation of elements
- Sound effects are made if a combination is not allowed or is allowed (very distinctive)
Animation:
- Some animation when a new item is created, when an item has been created or when a combination does not make a new item
- I like the clear screen option very helpful when there are a lot of items on the screen

###Notes:
Very fun game to play but can get boring after a while
Achievements or a tree of how many items can be made would be fun. Kind of like the Cool Math Games’ Run series. Just to know how much you need to go until you finish making everything possible.
