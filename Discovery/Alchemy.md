What are the gaming mechanics? 
- Rules
You combine elements together, two at a time. The game starts with the elements, “air,” “earth,” “fire,” and “water.” You cannot recreate an existing element.
- Number of players
There is one player for Alchemy who controls which elements are combined.
- Steps
You start out with two elements of your choice. Then, you drag one onto another to create a new element. Some elements do not combine well with each other and do not allow players to create new elements. 
- Goal
The goal of alchemy is to unlock and create all elements that exist within the game through experimentation.
	 
What is the user-experience? 
- Art style
The art style is characterized by cartoon icons. The color scheme revolves around the colors, brown and yellow, with exceptions to the actual element icons. For example, the general icons and font colors are yellow against a brown background.
- Music
The music is characterized by retro-style. There are sound effects when elements are selected and combined.
- Animation
There is a shaking animation when two elements cannot combine. When two elements can combine, there is a circling/scaling animation. Then, the game displays a full page of the new element, with slight scaling movement. There are also rays that revolve around the new element. To resume back to the game, the new element zooms out and its opacity reduces. There is also a clean-up animation that swipes the entire screen and rids the existing elements that were dragged out onto the “play area.”
- Interactions
The player drags elements on top of each other. There are clicks to exit out of a new element and to access general icons, like “settings” and hints.

Any other things you notice that are super interesting.
- It’s interesting to see how players cannot create an existing element twice or more. It seems a little restrictive in that sense, but it seems to help with experimentation purposes.
