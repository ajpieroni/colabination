# Discovery
## Alex: Notes on Little Alchemy
### Gaming Mechanics
- Mixing elements: The game revolves around mixing different elements to discover new ones. This includes combining like elements (x on x) as well as different elements (x on y).
- Combination results: There is either a new element created, or an element that has already been made.
  - On a new element, it will highlight on the screen.
  - On an old element, if made with an already discovered combintation, the result will flash up, but not combine. If it's a new combination, the element is made.
- Basic items: unlocked by statisfying certain conditions, not a combination
- Unlockable items: available when you accomplish certain goals
- Depleted items: once the item has gone through all possible combinations, no longer visible in sidebar
- Final items: can't be combined with anything, can remove by clicking on them in the canvas.
- Encyclopedia: holds records of combinations and resulting elements the user has created
### User Experience
- Music: 
  - There is a sound effect for a user combining items, along with retro music in the background which adds to the vibe.
- Animation/effects:
  - Item grows larger when user grabs it
  - Circle around item attempted to combine with
  - Shaking effect on failed combination
  - Double clicking on item duplicates it
- Visuals: 
  - New element is focused on screen
  - Some elements have boxes around them indicating... they're depleted?
  - Depleted items have circles around them on the canvas
  - Clean up button to clear canvas

### Other things to note:
- I think there could be a timer going on in the background that would auto provide possible combinations when the user gets stuck.


Sophia Bae:

What are the gaming mechanics? 
- Rules
You combine elements together, two at a time. The game starts with the elements, “air,” “earth,” “fire,” and “water.” You cannot recreate an existing element.
- Number of players
There is one player for Alchemy who controls which elements are combined.
- Steps
You start out with two elements of your choice. Then, you drag one onto another to create a new element. Some elements do not combine well with each other and do not allow players to create new elements. 
- Goal
The goal of alchemy is to unlock and create all elements that exist within the game through experimentation.
	 
What is the user-experience? 
- Art style
The art style is characterized by cartoon icons. The color scheme revolves around the colors, brown and yellow, with exceptions to the actual element icons. For example, the general icons and font colors are yellow against a brown background.
- Music
The music is characterized by retro-style. There are sound effects when elements are selected and combined.
- Animation
There is a shaking animation when two elements cannot combine. When two elements can combine, there is a circling/scaling animation. Then, the game displays a full page of the new element, with slight scaling movement. There are also rays that revolve around the new element. To resume back to the game, the new element zooms out and its opacity reduces. There is also a clean-up animation that swipes the entire screen and rids the existing elements that were dragged out onto the “play area.”
- Interactions
The player drags elements on top of each other. There are clicks to exit out of a new element and to access general icons, like “settings” and hints.

Any other things you notice that are super interesting.
- It’s interesting to see how players cannot create an existing element twice or more. It seems a little restrictive in that sense, but it seems to help with experimentation purposes.
